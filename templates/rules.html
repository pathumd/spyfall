              If you are a <b>detective</b>, determine who the spy is by asking questions. The questions being asked must not reveal obvious details of the location, so that the spy cannot easily determine it.<br><br>
              If you are the <b>spy</b>, you must guess the round’s location before the timer expires. Carefully listen to the questions being asked and the answers being given by the detectives to help you narrow down your guess.

              <b>Location:</b> Each player is assigned the same location, except for one player that is the spy.
              Moreover, the spy is not aware of the selected location.<br><br>
              <b>Questioning:</b> The game owner (player who created the game) will begin by questioning another player about
              the location. An example of this would be, "Is this location somewhere one would visit often?"<br><br>
              <b>Answering:</b> The questioned player must provide an answer. In addition, no follow-up questions are permitted.
              Once they provide an answer, it is now their turn to ask a question. This process repeats until the round is over.<br><br>
              <b>Retaliation questions:</b> If a player is asked a question and finishes answering, they are not allowed to immediately
              ask them a question back. Furthermore, you must ask a question from a different player.

              <b>Voting</b>: At any point in the game, a player can announce that they are suspicious of a player and can put them up
              for vote. For example, they must say "I'd like to put player X up for vote." Next, go one by one in a clockwise manner to 
              get each player to cast their vote.<br><br>
              If the consensus is that the plyaer is not suspicious, the game continues. Note that each player can only put a player up for vote once.
              Please use this wisely.<br><br>
              Once a player is indicted, they must reveal whether they are the spy or not. Once this happens, the game is over.
